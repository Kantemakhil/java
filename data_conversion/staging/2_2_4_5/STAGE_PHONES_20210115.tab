COMMENT ON COLUMN stage_phones.invalid_reason IS 'The reason the record has been marked as invalid. Used for feedback purposes prior to conversion. Not used by the conversion logic.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN stage_phones.invalid_flag IS 'A flag to indicate whether the record is considered invalid. Marked N by default. Updated to ''Y'' to flag possible problem records. Not used by conversion logic. Its purpose is to allow feedback on problem records during pre-conversion validation checking. Conversion logic will not attempt to sidestep these records, so faulty records should be reviewed and issues resolved prior to execution of conversion.';
