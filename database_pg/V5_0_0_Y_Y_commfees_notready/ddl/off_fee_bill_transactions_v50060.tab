comment on table OFF_FEE_BILL_TRANSACTIONS is 'Logs everything that happens against the bill such as: payments and reversals against the bill, bill adjustments, credits/offender adjustments, bill status changes, aging events.
Bill Transaction Types (column BILL_TXN_TYPE) are transaction types configured under OCMTRANS:
- initiall bill creation transaction- transaction types with TXN_USAGE = B [only one transaction type expected to be configured], (ex. CBILL) 
- bill payment transactions - transaction types with TXN_USAGE = R, (ex. BANK,CCASH,CCHK,CEFT,CMO,CWT)  
- bill payment reversal transactions - transaction types with TXN_USAGE = R, (ex. BANK,CCASH,CCHK,CEFT,CMO,CWT) 
- bill credit/offender adjustment transactions - transaction types with TXN_USAGE = A, (ex. CABE,CCANCL,CCLCS,CCMPRS,CWRTO)  
- bill credit/offender adjustment reversal transactions - transaction types with TXN_USAGE = A, (ex. CABE,CCANCL,CCLCS,CCMPRS,CWRTO)   
- bill adjustment/override decrease transactions - transaction types with TXN_USAGE = BD, (ex. BILLOD ) 
- bill adjustment/override increase transactions - transaction types with TXN_USAGE = BI, (ex. BILLOI ) 
- bill status escalation/de-escalation transactions (automatic or manual) do NOT have a transaction type 

To indicate which bill transactions increase vs decrease the bill balance owing:
-initiall bill creation transaction(there should be only one per bill) represents the bill ammount when the bill is created
-bill payment transactions decreases the bill balance owing
-bill payment reversal transactions (see original_bill_id and original_bill_txn_no) increases the bill balance owing
-bill credit/offender adjustment transactions decreases the bill balance owing 
-bill credit/offender adjustment reversal transactions (see original_bill_id and original_bill_txn_no) increases the bill balance owing
-bill adjustment/override decrease transactions decreases the bill balance owing 
-bill adjustment/override increase transactions increases the bill balance owing  
-bill transactions with no value for bill_txn_type do not affect the bill balance owing          

BILL_TXN_AMOUNT:
-BILL_TXN_AMOUNT represents the bill amount when the bill was generated for the initiall bill creation transaction
-BILL_TXN_AMOUNT represents the payment amount for bill payment transactions 
-BILL_TXN_AMOUNT represents the payment reversal amount for bill payment reversal transactions
-BILL_TXN_AMOUNT represents the credit/offender adjustment amount for bill credit/offender adjustment transactions
-BILL_TXN_AMOUNT represents the credit/offender adjustment reversal amount for bill credit/offender adjustment reversal transactions
-BILL_TXN_AMOUNT represents the bill amount adjustment for bill adjustment/override decrease or increase transactions
-BILL_TXN_AMOUNT is NULL for bill status escalation/de-escalation transactions and mandatory for all other transactions

Bill aging:
When the bill is included on a billing statement aka a biling statement is generated for the bill, the bill transactions have to record the bill aging start and end date for certain bill statuses:
--BILL_AGING_START_DATE is required for bill transactions with bill status AR, LD_PP, LD_EXI when the billing statement was generated for the bill or the bill is back dated and therefore the bill aging has started 
--BILL_AGING_END_DATE is required for bill transactions with bill status AR, LD_PP when the billing statement was generated for the bill or the bill is back dated and therefore the bill aging has started ';
